     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = VDW-DF ( 1  4  4  0 1 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want


     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     one sub-group per band group will be used
